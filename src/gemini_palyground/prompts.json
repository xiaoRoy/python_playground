      "My dental hygienist recommended an electric toothbrush,\n    which is why I got this. The battery life seems to be\n    pretty impressive so far. After initial charging and\n    leaving the charger plugged in for the first week to\n    condition the battery, I've unplugged the charger and\n    been using it for twice daily brushing for the last\n    3 weeks all on the same charge. But the toothbrush head\n    is too small. I’ve seen baby toothbrushes bigger than\n    this one. I wish the head was bigger with different\n    length bristles to get between teeth better because\n    this one doesn’t.  Overall if you can get this one\n    around the $50 mark, it's a good deal. The manufactuer's\n    replacements heads are pretty expensive, but you can\n    get generic ones that're more reasonably priced. This\n    toothbrush makes me feel like I've been to the dentist\n    every day. My teeth feel sparkly clean! ",
      "So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal\n    sale for around $49 in the month of November, about\n    half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging)\n    around the second week of December the prices all went\n    up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same\n    system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or\n    so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29.\n    So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part\n    where the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good\n    as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I\n    plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush\n    very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \n    blender first then pulverize them in the serving size\n    I want in the blender then switch to the whipping\n    blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade\n    first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade\n    if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making\n    smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and\n    vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \n    spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making\n    sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \n    that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so\n    much ice if at all-when making your smoothie.\n    After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise.\n    I called customer service but the warranty expired\n    already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall\n    quality has gone done in these types of products, so\n    they are kind of counting on brand recognition and\n    consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about\n    two days."
